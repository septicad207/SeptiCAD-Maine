1000 Gallon Septic Tank Contractor Shall Inspect Baffles/Covers and Replace If Necessary
------------------------------
Scarify all ground to be filled. Remove vegetation and organic loam topsoil.  Scarify soil to a depth of 6 to 8 inches by mixing gravelly coarse sand with native soil using a rototiller or a backhoe bucket with teeth.  Do not use a backhoe bucket without teeth because it can compact and smear the underlying soil.
Site Evaluator assumes the contractor will install building foundation and sewer piping at an elevation that allow gravity drainage from septic tank to disposal field; therefore, a pump station is not required.
Final grade must allow stormwater to drain around disposal field and fill extension.

Contractor to construct surface water diversion swales to direct stormwater away/around disposal field and fill extensions.
