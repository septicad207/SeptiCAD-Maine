%SCAR-1%Scarify all ground to be filled. Remove vegetation and organic loam topsoil.  Scarify soil to a depth of 6 to 8 inches by mixing 4 inches of gravelly coarse sand with native soil using an excavator bucket with teeth.  Do not use a bucket without teeth because it can compact and smear the underlying soil.
