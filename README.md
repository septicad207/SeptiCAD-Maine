# SeptiCAD-Maine
Septic System design software created by a Mainer for Mainers - but it can be a template for other things too.

To use this software in the "default" condition.  Download the entire package as a ZIP file, rename the

"SeptiCAD-Maine-main" folder in the ZIP file to "SeptiCADv5", and put the folder into the root C: hard drive.

You can put it in a different spot on your computer, but then you will have to change directory pointers in SeptiCADv5.LSP
